## Installation

There is no installation needed as this will work with any browser.

## Usage

This site allows the user to create a workout and add exercises to the workout so that their workout stats can be tracked. The site allows the user to create a new workout or add to their current workout. Once exercises are added to the workout, the user can go to a dashboard page to see their overall stats for all of their workouts.
